# Sorting numbers from txt. file
## (Simple cmd-application) 

When launching the application, it requests the path to the file to be sorted.
The application ignores all characters except individual numbers.

## Example:

File contents: 
```
1f2e 3 5 4 gfd45 7 8 6 9hdf 10
```

Output: 
```
  Not sorted: 1f2e 3 5 4 gfd45 7 8 6 9hdf 10
  Sorted: [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10]
```  
Output will be saved to file.
